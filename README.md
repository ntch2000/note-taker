## Installation

There is no installation required for this application as it is hosted on a Heroku server. You can access the [Note Taker Application](https://blooming-chamber-39925.herokuapp.com/).

## Usage

To utilize this application, go to the application link provided and click "Get Started". This will open the note taker dashboard, allowing the user to write new notes, view previously saved notes, and delete notes that are no longer needed.

When the user begins typing in the title of the note and the text of the note, the save icon will appear in the top right corner allowing the note to be saved.

Clicking on the saved note titles on the left allows users to pull up previously saved notes. These notes can also be deleted by clicking the red trash icon next to the note the user wants to delete.
